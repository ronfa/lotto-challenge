# Case Back-end Developer
NLO organizes a new promotional game. A website needs to be developed where visitors see a huge
surprise calendar with 10000 scratchable areas. In one area there is the main prize of 25000 euros.
There are 100 consolation prizes hidden. A visitor of the website can only scratch open one area.
They can see which squares have already been opened by other users.
In the programming language and framework of your choice:
- Create a web page that holds the surprise calendar. It does not need to have any styling. It can be
an unstyled grid of 100x100 squares.
- If a user clicks on a cell he will see whether he has won something
- When reloading the page, state must be preserved
- There is no need to build an authentication mechanism, so you can simply simulate multiple users
using the website.
